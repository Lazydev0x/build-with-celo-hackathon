#### Project Description

Trade and commerce are the major drivers of economic growth and also constitute a critical part of human existence. In Africa, the absence of a generally accepted local currency and the volatile nature of individual currencies make commerce difficult, thus hindering economic growth. Due to this challenge, cross-border payment within Africa is done majorly in dollars. But dollars are usually in the firm grip of big corporations and the government such that SMEs—the backbone of every economy—have little or no access to it for business.

In recent times, with greater efficiency, greater financial inclusion, and more innovation, digital currencies and payment systems have tremendously benefited consumers and society as a whole. Stablecoins, especially, are gradually gaining ground as the most acceptable means of payment due to its fast, secure, affordable and easily transferable nature, with more than $185 billion worth of stablecoins circulating in the global market. 

In 2021, Chainanalysis, a blockchain data platform, reported that cryptocurrency adoption exploded across Africa with a 1,200% increase from 2020. This adoption was driven by the use of stablecoins for savings, remittances and commercial transactions, with cross-region transfers reportedly constituting a bigger share of Africa’s cryptocurrency market (96%) than all other regions combined (78%).

But despite this recent progress in the adoption and use of crypto, particularly stablecoins, for commerce, savings (to hedge against inflation), and cross-border remittances in Africa, businesses on the continent still struggle to integrate crypto offerings into their platforms. This ultimately reduces their ability to scale and plug into the opportunities in the global market.

This is where Make comes in, to help African businesses plug into this future of commerce driven by stablecoins.
